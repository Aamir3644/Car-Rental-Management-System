## What is Spring ?
>> Spring is a widely adopted open-source framework for Java application development. It simplifies building enterprise-level applications by promoting concepts like Dependency Injection (DI). It offers robust solutions for data access, transaction management, security, and web application development, making it a popular choice in the Java development community.

## What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot ?
>> Spring is a comprehensive framework for building Java-based enterprise applications. It offers a collection of modules and tools that address various aspects of application development.Spring provides flexibility but requires developers to configure many aspects of the application manually.
>> Spring Boot, on the other hand, is an extension of the Spring framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of Spring-based applications. It provides default configurations, auto-configuration, and embedded servers, reducing the need for extensive XML configuration.
Examples : 
          - Spring is like a toolbox with various tools that you can use to build a Java application. However, it requires you to configure and set up many things manually.
          - Spring Boot, on the other hand, is like a pre-assembled toolkit. It takes care of a lot of the setup and configuration for you, so you can get started quickly. It's like having a default set of tools ready to use out of the box.
